== Women's World's of Qajar Iran

This open source rails application is an effort to construct an English/
Persian front end to a new archive of primary sources on Iranian history
and in particular the history of women in the Qajar Period, roughly 1800 
to 1930. Comments and advice are welcome.

As this project moved to open source, we removed the database, secret_tokens,
and username and password credentials from the repository.  Those settings are
controlled by secret_token.rb and security_credentials.rb in the 
config/initializers directory.  You will need to create your own versions
of those files using the templates provided.  The deploy.rb script also 
loads the security_credentials.rb in order to create those files on the fly 
on the server during setup and deployment.  

Version: 1.5.2

== Deployment

Instructions for EC2 deployment.

Start with a Ubuntu 11.04 LTS image, then:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
    $ sudo apt-get -y install curl bison build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev libxml2-dev git-core

Install system ruby so we can run shadow_puppet

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems
    $ sudo gem install shadow_puppet --no-ri --no-rdoc
    $ sudo gem install i18n --no-ri --no-rdoc

Now install RVM (could be in a manifest)

    $ bash < <(curl -sk https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
    $ rvm install 1.9.2
    $ rvm use 1.9.2@global
    $ gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
    $ rvm use 1.9.2@wwqi --create

Then make sure you have rvm installed locally:

    $ cap deploy:setup

Not from then on, you just run:

    $ cap deploy
